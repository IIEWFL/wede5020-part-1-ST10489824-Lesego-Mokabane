                    <p><strong>What Kids Learn:</strong> Coordination, focus, discipline.</p>
                    <p>
                        The first activity offered by UYL was tennis, which still motivates a lot of young players today. As they practice serving, rallying, and playing matches, kids improve their hand-eye coordination, focus, and confidence. Tennis promotes amicable rivalry while simultaneously fostering personal accountability.

                        discipline, and teamwork.  The development of skills, strategy, and sportsmanship are the
                        main objectives of our curriculum.
