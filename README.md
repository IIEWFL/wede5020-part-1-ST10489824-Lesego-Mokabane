<b>Project Overview<b>
The United young League website is a community-driven initiative designed to highlight the league's history, programs, and community impact while encouraging the growth of young sports.  In addition to discussing the organization's vision, principles, and accomplishments, it emphasizes possibilities for kids ages 6 to 16 to participate in sports like basketball, cricket, tennis, soccer, and athletics.  The website, which was created using HTML and CSS, has specific pages for Home, About, Programs, Volunteer, Contact, and Registration. This makes information and sign-up forms easily accessible to parents, players, and community members.  The design places a strong emphasis on responsiveness, accessibility, and simplicity, laying the groundwork for upcoming improvements using JavaScript-based interactivity.
