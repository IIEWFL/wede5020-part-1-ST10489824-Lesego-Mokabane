<strong>Project Overview</strong>

The United young League website is a community-driven initiative designed to highlight the league's history, programs, and community impact while encouraging the growth of young sports. In addition to discussing the organization's vision, principles, and accomplishments, it emphasizes possibilities for kids ages 6 to 16 to participate in sports like basketball, cricket, tennis, soccer, and athletics.  The website, which was created using HTML and CSS, has specific pages for Home, About, Programs, Volunteer, Contact, and Registration. This makes information and sign-up forms easily accessible to parents, players, and community members. Accessibility, simplicity, and responsiveness are given top priority in the design, which lays a solid fundation for upcoming improvements like JavaScript-based interactivity.

<strong>Website Goals and Objectives</strong>

1. <strong>Improve accessibility:</strong> Provide easy registration, mobile-friendly design, and 
intuitive navigation. 
2. <strong>Showcase achievements:</strong> Highlight player success stories, events, and 
sponsorships. 
3. <strong>Promote involvement:</strong> Share league news and emphasize benefits such as 
free sports kits for members. 
4. <strong>Support fundraising:</strong> Sell branded merchandise online to generate funds and 
promote community identity.
